.SYNOPSIS
  Stores a number of variables, grabs all files sitting in a local or remote file share, and uploads the files to an Azure Storage 
  Account.

.DESCRIPTION
  This script will upload files to Azure Storage with a PutBlob call, using a shared access signature (SAS) key. Generating the header
  is difficult, so using a SAS key will be easier.

.PARAMETER 
  Required: storage account name, storage account container, shared access signature key, file path, and files

.INPUTS
  None

.OUTPUTS
  None
